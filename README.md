## About me

A highly motivated Software Developer, with too many project ideas and too little time.

I have a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and possess a range of skills, knowledge and experience gained through academic study and work. I work effectively with others and am highly capable of working on my own initiative. I bring an enthusiastic approach to work and with excellent attention to detail, with the ability to plan projects and prioritise conflicting demands. Having achieved a high academic standard, I am now committed to building a successful and rewarding career with a progressive company offering the opportunity for additional personal career development.

I have just completed a software development course at Makers Academy, where I was able to develop my skills in line with best industry practices.
